# UX / Styling
- [ ] mobile responsive styling
  - [ ] make center panels fullscreen at mobile size
  - [ ] make the description and userlist collapsible
  - [ ] 1px scrollbars on mobile
  - [ ] always show tab close buttons on mobile
  - [ ] possibly remove transition styles for performance
- [ ] redo the chat colors (currently absent)
- [ ] add a waiting status screen for logging in and other slow operations
- [ ] add dividers to split up the interface a bit
- [ ] look into optionally darklighting OOC? complicated and unreliable, but an interesting thought...
- [ ] on application start, scroll the character list down so the selected character is within view
- [ ] (offline app) remove window border, add custom window buttons
- [ ] create a checkbox component to use instead of the default HTML checkbox, for styling, more functionality and such
- [ ] make the tabs reorderable... _ugh_
- [ ] add a view to read the channel description on a larger panel instead of needing to scroll through that tiny div
- [ ] add icons to tabs to indicate tab type (public channel, private channel, PM, etc.)
- [ ] render channel/session BBC links
- [ ] put .noselect on the friend tooltips in CharacterMenu
- [ ] add notification sounds
- [ ] hide the "bookmark" and "ignore" options (and other irrelevant options) on self characters
- [ ] only show app menu if there are no active channels loaded from storage
- [x] ~~translate statuses into human readable text in CharacterMenu~~ unnecessary
- [x] friendly titles!
- [x] add close buttons for the tabs
- [x] add more shortcuts
- [x] open the app menu by default instead of the channel menu
- [x] close the app menu when selecting an option
- [x] use a state stack for overlays, for better UX experience
- [x] show gender in character menu
- [x] fix the private chat view
- [x] TRANSITIONS
- [x] add hover-darken to character list items

# Optimization / Cleanup
- [ ] move user / session storage to an offline JSON config file
  - [ ] also consider using firebase for user prefs? mostly because of the storage limit on mobile
- [ ] return a null character from the store to handle offline users
- [ ] limit the size of the message list to prevent hardcore memory leaks
- [ ] (offline app) move socket logic to application side out of the view
- [ ] add a global getter for the application version
- [x] create an interface for session storage to support multiple platforms later on
- [x] ~~rewrite style classes to account a little better for collisions~~ not necessary
- [x] ~~use computed() less, wherever possible~~ turns out there are probably more useful optimizations we can make here
- [x] organize components into subfolders (overlays, chat views, etc.)
- [x] find a way to solve the bottleneck rendering 400~500 character elements at once
- [x] holy memory usage batman
- [x] ~~find a better way to organize chat tabs declaratively~~ just using events and not being stupid with focusing works
- [x] make a file for reference events that pass through the program
- [x] move to electron

# Bugs
- [x] fix the goddamn overlays
- [x] fix most things broken with the socket handler
- [x] characters are not removed from active channels when they go offline
- [x] bookmarks seem a little wonky. look into that
- [x] fix the login data from authentication
- [x] private channels are broken
- [x] closing a tab activates it awkwardly before actually closing it
- [ ] does not save last active character
