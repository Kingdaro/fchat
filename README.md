# F-Chat Next
> An alternative F-Chat client with modern, intuitive, and responsive design in mind.

<!-- [Live Demo](http://kingdaro.github.io/fchat) -->

<!-- ## Note: Incomplete!
This client's not quite finished yet, but is in a usable state, so feel free to test for bugs and such.

If you do happen to find a bug, or if you have any suggestions, comments or concerns, [submit an issue for it](https://github.com/Kingdaro/fchat/issues), or note me at [Alexander Grapevine](https://www.f-list.net/c/alexander%20grapevine/) on F-List. -->
